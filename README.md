# Real-Time-Meeting-Insights-with-Generative-AI

This project involves developing an AI model designed to automatically generate Minutes of Meeting (MoM) from diverse data sources. The system utilizes Google Generative AI, Streamlit, and several custom-built functions to enhance processing accuracy and overall model performance.

Through prompt engineering, the model is guided to extract and interpret text from multiple file formats—including PDFs, images, and DOCX documents—and produce a detailed summary and analysis of the extracted content.

The project demonstrates how AI models can be trained to retrieve and process information from heterogeneous sources, showcasing their potential for solving real-world data extraction and summarization challenges.
